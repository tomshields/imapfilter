The latest version is <b>0.8</b>. You can download the latest version
as <a href="imapfilter_0.8.tar.gz">imapfilter_0.8.tar.gz</a>.
<p>ImapFilter is a <a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a> program for filtering
an <a href="http://www.imap.org/">IMAP</a> mailbox according to a set of rules.
I use ImapFilter to filter my inbox into a set of IMAP folders. I also
use it for mail folder maintenance, by running a different rules file over
each folder periodically. The advantage this has over other filters
(e.g. procmail, mailagent, and zfilter) is that it is totally independent
of the mail delivery.
<p>There are two mailing lists for ImapFilter, one for general discussion
and help, and another for announcements. They are coming soon...
<p>ImapFilter was originally written by <a href="http://www.basswood.com/ts/index.html">Tom
Shields</a>, 4/4/1998
<p>ImapFilter includes the following required packages:
<ul>
<li>
Net::IMAP by Kevin Johnson &lt;kjj@pobox.com></li>
<li>
Date::Parse by Graham Barr &lt;Graham.Barr@pobox.com></li>
</ul>
Contributions to ImapFilter are always welcome, and may be emailed to <a href="mailto:imapfilter@basswood.com">imapfilter@basswood.com</a>.
Here is the current ToDo list:
<ul>
<li>
Finish MAIL, REJECT functions</li>
<li>
Built-in to canonicalize an email address, e.g. From/Reply-To</li>
<li>
Add ABORT to bail out entirely and stop processing messages</li>
<li>
Parse message flags for filter use (could write 'summary' filter showing
new, seen, total in folder)</li>
<li>
Add "copyandmarkread" semantic, for archive folders - 2nd param to COPY?</li>
<li>
Add BEGIN and END block semantics to filters for one-time init and shutdown
- can simulate now, but ugly</li>
<li>
Use getopt for option processing</li>
<li>
Allow configuration parameters to be set via command line</li>
<li>
Improve fetch efficiency by getting more than one header at a time</li>
<li>
Figure out way to encrypt password in conf file</li>
<li>
Built-in handling of ranges and lists of message numbers efficiently</li>
<li>
Add equivalent of perl's "-e" flag for short filters - maybe use "-" to
mean read script from stdin</li>
<li>
Clean up signal handling a bit - remove lock file</li>
<li>
Handle message on stdin - use "-" as folder - would need to be able to
store message in IMAP folder</li>
<li>
Write 'imapfolder' for folder create/delete/empty/list all/summarize</li>
</ul>
