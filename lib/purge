#
# purge - ImapFilter filter to purge messages older than n days
#
# usage: imapfilter foldername purge [days]
# days defaults to 30
#
# bugs:
#   uses the Date: header to determine the age of the message - it should
#   probably use the envelope From instead
#   purge 0 doesn't work like expected - use purge -1 instead
#
