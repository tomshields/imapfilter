#
# read - ImapFilter filter to mark read messages older than n days
#
# usage: imapfilter foldername read [days]
# days defaults to 30
#
# bugs:
#   uses the Date: header to determine the age of the message - it should
#   probably use the envelope From instead
#   read 0 doesn't work like expected - use read -1 instead
#
